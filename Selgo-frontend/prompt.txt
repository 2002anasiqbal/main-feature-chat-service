Mark Backend Integration Points

Use // BACKEND INTEGRATION POINT at every place where the backend developer needs to make changes (e.g., API calls, data passing, modifying responses).
Provide Placeholder API Logic

Include API call logic but comment it out, so it's clear where the backend should insert actual FastAPI endpoints.
State Management for API Data

Ensure proper state handling for fetching, updating, and rendering backend data.
Indicate Mock Code Removal

Clearly mark mock data or unnecessary placeholder code with // REMOVE THIS AFTER BACKEND INTEGRATION, so the backend developer knows what to delete once the API is connected.
Keep Functionality Intact

Ensure the component works the same while preparing it for seamless backend integration.
Suggest Improvements

Recommend better API handling approaches if needed (e.g., caching, error handling, or optimizations).
